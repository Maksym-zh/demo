Mmm, mmm
It's been seven long hours
Since you left me babe
Sitting here
Thinking 'bout how
How you let it slip away
I can't get no sleep
(No sleep)
Don't even want to
Go nowhere
It's on my mind
What you did wrong
And now you
want to come back

When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
He's been out there too long
She won't even
Talk on the phone
(Settle this, settle this)
When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
Can't come around
There ain't no place
She don't want to
See your face

Said you never
Wanted to hurt me
Never even wanted to leave
Said that you
Never did deserve me
Now you begging me
Please, please, please believe
Now you feeling like a fool
(Fool)
Never thought about me
Just you
